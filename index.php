		<p style="text-align:justify">Internet has become the nerve centre of todayâ€™s age. Be it online transactions, online shopping, or other related applications, internet plays a vital role. But there exists a problem of slow convergence of routing protocols after a network failure, which gives slow reaction and fosters instability. Thus to ensure fast recovery from link and node failures in IP networks, this project presents a recovery scheme called Multiple Routing Configurations (MRC). The proposed scheme guarantees recovery in all single failure scenarios, using a single mechanism to handle both link and node failures, and without knowing the root cause of the failure. MRC is strictly connectionless, and assumes only destination based hop-by-hop forwarding. MRC is based on keeping additional routing information in the routers, and allows packet forwarding to continue on an alternative output link immediately after the detection of a failure.</p>
